Norchi - Girchi Party Ideological Challenge System
This is a Next.js 15 application built for Girchi, a libertarian political party from Georgia. The system creates interactive "ideological trap" dialogues that challenge users' beliefs through branching conversations, designed to expose contradictions in thinking or reinforce libertarian principles of individual freedom, personal responsibility, and minimal government interference.
Tech Stack:
Next.js 15 with TypeScript and React 19
Tailwind CSS 4 with shadcn/ui components
ReactFlow for visual flow graphs
Lucide React icons

Philosophy: Challenge populist/authoritarian thinking through structured debates on controversial topics like drug legalization, military service, and personal freedoms. Guide users through logical sequences that either expose belief contradictions or strengthen libertarian convictions.
